# Layout from scratch

## Indications

- Time for you to create your first layout and code from scratch.
- Create a folder in your local machine with the same repo name `activity--layout-flexbox-scratch`.
- This time, save your styles into a `css` folder *and don’t forget to link it in your HTML*.

**Maybe you want to include box-sizing at the top of your stylesheet.**

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
